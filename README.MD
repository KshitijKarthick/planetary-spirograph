## Description
I saw a [GIF](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3dpp0v/8_earth_years_are_roughly_equal_to_13_venus_years/) on Reddit that was interesting to watch. It's a visualization of a pattern that the earth and venus trace out since their revolution times are different. I wanted to play with the velocities and the orbit radii to see what other patterns would emerge. This little project is the result of that.
